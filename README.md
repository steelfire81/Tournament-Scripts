# Tournament-Scripts
A set of work-in-progress shell scripts for small tournament organization tasks.

I plan on using this repository to share small shell scripts dedicated to menial tournament-related tasks.  A lot of what goes in here is or will be shell versions of tasks in the Tournament Tracker ( https://github.com/steelfire81/TournamentTracker ).  These scripts are mostly just things to do when I get bored, so this repository will likely not be updated often.
